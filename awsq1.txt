1- Create an instance from the available ubuntu Ami's.
2- Select storage option and vpc ,subnets.
3- In the SG allow HTTP,SSH and NFS inbound Rules.
4- Launch your instance
5- Create an EFS.
6- MAke sure that the SG of the EC2 Instance and the efs are the same.
7- Connect the EC2 instance through Mobaxterm using SSH.

Connect to your EC2 instance and install the Apache web server.
$ sudo yum -y install httpd

Start the service.
$ sudo service httpd start

Create a mount point
Create a subdirectory efs-mount-point under /var/www/html
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/efs-mount-point

Mount your Amazon EFS file system. You need to update the following mount command using the EFS mount helper utility by providing your file system ID
$ sudo mount -t efs <your EFS ID>:/ /var/www/html/efs-mount-point

Create a sample html file and change the directory
$ cd /var/www/html/efs-mount-point 

Make a subdirectory for sampledir and change the ownership. And change directory so you can create files in the sampledir subdirectory
$  sudo mkdir sampledir  
$  sudo chown  ec2-user sampledir
$  sudo chmod -R o+r sampledir
$  cd sampledir

Create a sample test.html file
$ echo "<html><h1>Hello Abhishek ,from Amazon EFS</h1></html>" > test.html

Open a browser window and enter the URL to access the file (it is the public DNS name of the EC2 instance followed by the file name)
http://EC2-instance-public-DNS/efs-mount-point/sampledir/test.html




NOW, 
Create an snapshot of the above EC2 instance using the AWS Snapshot console and Create a volume from this instance
Choose a different region and create an instance
Attach the created volume to it.
